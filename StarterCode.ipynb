      "5. Add the finely chopped onions to the pan and saut√© until they become translucent.\n",
      "6. Add the minced garlic and sliced banana peppers, and cook for 5 minutes.\n",
      "7. Add the diced carrots to the pan and cook for about 10 minutes until they are soft.\n",
      "8. Now, add the cooked oats and rice to the pan and mix well. Cook for another 5 minutes so that everything is well combined.\n",
      "9. Correct the seasoning by adding salt, if needed.\n",
      "10. Once done, turn off the heat and let the Spicy Carrot and Oats Rice sit for a few minutes before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy this healthy, spicy, and flavorful dish. Remember, you can always adjust the amount of banana peppers based on your preference for spiciness. Also, adding a bit of lime juice can enhance the overall flavor of this dish.\n"
