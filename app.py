2. A section called **Grocery List:** ‚Äî grouped by category  
3. A section called **Full Recipes:** ‚Äî each recipe should include:

4. The full recipe section should read like a cook book level instruction with ingredient measurments and temperatures depending on what is needed for the recipe

# 1. Suggest 3 meal recipes they might be making regularly.
# 2. Create a smart grocery list for the upcoming week that includes all the ingredients needed for those recipes, avoids duplicates from long-lasting pantry items (like oats, peanut butter), and includes reasonable variety.
# 3. Make sure the grocery list order makes sense so group things like veggies, fruits or breads like they would be in a grocery store next to each other.
# 4. Keep the grocery list between 20 and 30 items.
# 5. At the end give full recipe descriptions with instructions like in a cook book for each recipe 
# 6. Output the results in this format:


# Recipes:
# - Recipe 1: [name]
